![Balance Is Everything](https://github.com/Kurooco/HonorsProject/blob/main/art/ui/bie_title1.png?raw=true)
This is my honors project for my last year at Knox College. The purpose of the project is two-fold:
- To create a functioning game that mixes elements of fast-paced and slow-paced gameplay
- To complete user testing in order to determine if the difference in pace has any effect on the enjoyment that players have while playing.

This game is still a work in progress.
