I've been thinking a lot about life lately.
You ever feel like we're all just caught in some painful, meaningless loop that ultimately takes us nowhere?
Why are we all here anyway?[pause=1] What's the point?
I wouldn't mind life being meaningless if it wasn't so hard.
Have you seen how many razors there are out in the fields these days? It gets harder and harder to migrate every year. I don't know how long I can keep this up.
Every innovation just seems to bring more hardship. Whoever installed those razors obviously wasn't thinking of the birds that have to fly through them.
...[pause=1]Sorry,[pause=.5] I'm not a very fun companion, am I?
It's birds like you that give me hope. You look like you've got plenty of energy left to take you where you want to go.
Be careful out there, okay?
